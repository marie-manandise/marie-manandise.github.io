    <p>I am currently managing the Front-End team at <a href="https://studio24.net">Studio 24</a>. This involves people management and the maintenance of our Front-End standards and best practices.</p>
    <p>As a senior Web Developer, my role requires both technical and business skills (a combination I enjoy very much!)</p>
    <p>I act as 'Tech lead' on some projects, ensuring the smooth running of their technical aspects.</p>
    <p>At other times, I am responsible for devising and running 'Discovery phases'. These consist in identifying user needs, business requirements, and technical constraints for clients who are investing in a digital asset. And then working out the most suitable solution. (Some call it Business Analysis.)</p>
    <p>I started off a front-end developer (HTML, CSS, "cosmetic" JavaScript) in the context of PHP-based CMSes (<a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, mainly).</p>
    <p>Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies: working in the context of a <a href="https://www.studio24.net/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">headless CMS architecture</a>, coding a <a href="https://www.studio24.net/blog/the-essence-of-progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web App</a>, acting as a consultant/business analyst in the context of large projects.</p>
    <h2>Things that got me here</h2>
    <ul class="timeline">
      <li>
        <p><span>1982</span> Born in Charleroi, Belgium</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>2001 - 2005</span> Study Biology at the <a href="https://www.ulb.be/">Universite Libre de Bruxelles</a>.
          As part of my course, I learn to program in Pascal (does this make me feel old!)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>Sept. 2005</span> Move to London for a combined Masters/PhD in Modelling Biological Systems at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/complex/">University College London</a>. (I've never been one to chase butterflies in the fields. I'd rather debug a script.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>2006 - 2009</span> Things don't quite work out for me in the academic world. I quit my Masters to work as a special needs teaching assistant in secondary schools.
        </p>
        <p>
          I need to come down my fluffy academic cloud and teach pupils with learning difficulties. Anything I say needs to be <strong>crystal clear</strong>. This is one of the most important skills I will ever learn.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>Summer 2008</span> I wake up with the urge do make websites for a living. Two weeks later I'm signed up to a Web Applications Development course with the <a href="http://www.openuniversity.edu/">Open University</a>. I will never know how or why I came up with that but I don't regret it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>Sept. 2009</span> I am looking for Web Development jobs. Everyone wants me to have eons of experience and a solid portfolio.</p>
        <p>Sod it! I'm going freelance. If I'm building a portfolio, I might as well build it for myself.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>2009 - 2016</span> I trade as M.A.J. Web. I start with small websites, the code of which would make me cringe now. I get better with every project.</p>
        <p>And I learn <strong>a lot about business</strong>. The law of supply and demand kicks me in the face so I start learning WordPress. Over the years, I become somewhat of a WordPress specialist.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>2011 - 2013</span> I spend a little over a year in Osaka, Japan, then under a year back in Belgium - freelancing remotely. I've forgotten quite a bit of Japanese but I suspect I'm still fluent in ordering food.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>2014</span> Move to Cambridge, UK. Business picks up.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>2016 - 2021</span> Studio 24, which was gradually becoming my biggest client, offers me a job. I'm four-month pregnant at the time and they are happy to accommodate me with a part-time position. Also, I will be working on projects I could only dream of as a freelancer.</p>
        <p>It turns out my work mates are lovely. I learn zillions of things related to large web projects (scrum tools, git, front-end build tools, you name it).</p>
        <p>I start as a front-end developer and over the years become WordPress Lead Developer and then Senior Web Developer.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><span>2018 - Now</span> I move back to Belgium for personal reasons. I still work for Studio 24, remotely. Yup, I was doing it before it was mainstream ;)</p></li>
      <li><p><span>2021 - Now</span> I become Front-End Team Lead at Studio 24.</p></li>
